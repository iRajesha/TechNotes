## Some important notes on styling 

1.  SASS - Syntactically awesome style sheets - This is a pre-processer which allows us to do some interesting things in static CSS
2.  SASS includes 
    -   Partials : Dividing one CSS file to many 
    -   Inheritance : Extend one styling to extend another one
    -   Nesting : Nest stylings like html tags
    -    Mixins are reusable CSS declarations, with support for parameters. They are useful for grouping CSS declarations and, like extending, can help to avoid code repetition.
